# calculator
This code represents a simple calculator in the C# programming language. It allows the user to input two numbers and an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and calculates the result based on the input. The main goal of this program is to provide the user with the ability to perform basic mathematical operations conveniently.

The program starts by inputting the first number, after which the user is prompted to enter the operation and the second number. It then uses a switch statement to determine which operation to perform and displays the result of the calculations. It's important to consider the possibility of division by zero, and the program will output an appropriate message if the second number is zero.

This program demonstrates basic concepts of input, data processing, and the switch conditional statement in C#. It can be useful for teaching beginners the fundamentals of programming.
